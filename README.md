 MNIST ResNet Training

 📌 Project Overview:
This project trains a ResNet18 model on the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits 0-9) using PyTorch. The dataset is preprocessed, the model is fine-tuned, and its performance is evaluated.

 📝 Data Preprocessing:
- Loads the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits 0-9).
- Converts grayscale images to RGB (3 channels) for compatibility with CNN models.
- Resizes images to 224x224 to match ResNet18 input requirements
- 🏗️ Model Selection & Modification:
- Uses a pre-trained ResNet18 model from PyTorch.
- Replaces the final fully connected layer to classify 10 digits (0-9).

🎯 Training Process:
- Uses CrossEntropyLoss as the loss function.
- Optimizes the model using the Adam optimizer.
- Trains the model for 5 epochs with a batch size of 32.

📊 Model Evaluation:
- Evaluates the model on the test dataset.
- Computes accuracy based on correct predictions.

🚀 Results & Performance:
- Displays loss per epoch during training.
- Computes final accuracy on test data.
